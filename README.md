# JoystickPlugin

This plugin uses SDL2 functions to pass input to the Unreal Engine Gameplay Input Loop.

Thank you to tsky1971, Ikarus76 and samiljan for the good working basis.
Also thanks to brifsttar for assisting in finding bugs!

## What is the purpose of this plugin?

This plugin aims to provide a simple plug and play system for Joysticks, Steering Wheels and Gamepads (with Forced Feedback capabilities) for Unreal Engine 4/5.

## How is this any different to the existing plugins?

Most of the other plugins require developers to re-compile SDL2 (the framework the plugins are built on) - which can be a real pain for beginners!  
Thankfully JoystickPlugin comes built ontop of the existing implmentation within Unreal Engine; so no messing about with DLLs.
